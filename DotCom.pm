=head1 NAME

Chess::Games::DotCom - API for accessing chessgames.com

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  shell> perl -MChess::Games::DotCom -e  game_of_day
  shell> perl -MChess::Games::DotCom -e 'game_of_day("myfile.pgn")'

  shell> perl -MChess::Games::DotCom -e  puzzle_of_day
  shell> perl -MChess::Games::DotCom -e 'puzzle_of_day("myfile.pgn")'

Download games from chessgames.com.

A script in scripts suitable for invocation from cron is included.

=head1 API

Downloads the game of the day. If C<$filename> is not specified, then
it downloads it to C<game_of_day.pgn>.

Downloads the puzzle of the day. If C<$filename> is not specified, then
it downloads it to C<puzzle_of_day.pgn>.

=head2 EXPORT

C<game_of_day>
C<puzzle_of_day>

=head1 NEW FEATURES

=head2 in 0.08

For C<puzzle_of_day()>,
parsed out "$color to move and win" and stored in the PlyCount header of
PGN so that I could see where the puzzle began.

Too see an example of a log of auto-downloaded games, visit:

http://princepawn.perlmonk.org/chess/pgn/montreux.html

=head2 in 0.07

Added a sample cron file for daily automatic retrieval of puzzle of day.

Added Log::Agent logging to sample retrieval script

=head2 in 0.06

C<puzzle_of_day> was added


=head1 TODO

Download other daily game parts of the site
