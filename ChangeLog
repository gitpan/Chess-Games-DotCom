	* Switched Changes file to ChangeLog so it is easier to find in
	emacs

	Actually got the potd script (below) to work on Cygwin. Winboard
	uses Windows-style paths so absolute paths in Cygwin don't work
	properly. Solution was to cd to the directory and use a relative
	path. 

	* Added $DIST/scripts/potd so that one can easily view the latest
	puzzle of the day game via winboard. Uploaded as version 1.0.
